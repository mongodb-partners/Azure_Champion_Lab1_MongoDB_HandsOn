# Hands-on Tour of MongoDB Atlas

## Overview
MongoDB Atlas is a developer data platform integrating a multi-cloud database with a diverse set of data services. Atlas simplifies database deployment and management while enabling modern data-driven application development.

In this introductory-level lab, you will get hands-on practice with MongoDB Atlas. You will create your first forever-free cluster and set up App Services, including a GraphQL API. If you’re new to Atlas, you came to the right place! Read on to learn about this lab's specifics and areas you will get hands-on practice.

## Objectives
In this lab, you will do the following:
  - Provision your first MongoDB Atlas cluster
  - Create a database and collections with data
  - Set up App Services GraphQL API
  - Query data with the generated GraphQL API
  
 ## Prerequisites
 Since this lab is an introduction to MongoDB Atlas, you will need an Atlas account. You can register for MongoDB Atlas in one of two ways:
    1. Through the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/mongodb.mongodb_atlas_self_serve_prod_2022?ocid=mongodb_iotmanufacturing_blog_FY23) if you have an Azure account. Refer to the [documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/billing/azure-self-serve-marketplace/) to set up your subscription.
    2. With the [Atlas registration page](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register)
   
 ## Create an Atlas project and cluster
 In this section, you will get up and running, spinning up your first cluster and database.
